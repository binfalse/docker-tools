# Docker Tools

This is a suite of tools that will come in handy if you're working with Docker.
The suite contains:

* `dclean` can be used to get rid of old, exited Docker containers and dangling images.
* `denter` will give you quick access into a shell of any running container.
* `dip` shows the IP addresses of running containers.
* `dkill` helps you killing all running containers with a single command.
* `dupdate` will update all images that you've downloaded from any registry.

As you see, all tools agree on the leading `d` ;-)
